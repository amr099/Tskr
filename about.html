            Tskr was born from the frustrations and challenges faced by its
            once-freelancer founders. Having navigated the turbulent waters of
            competing platforms, they firsthand witnessed the deteriorating
            dynamics - the inundation of spam, escalating scams, rising costs,
            and the often-unfair power imbalances between clients and
            freelancers. Over time, these platforms seemed to stray from their
            original mission, often at the expense of the very freelancers they
            were meant to serve.
            <br />
            <br />
            Understanding the gravity of what freelancers risk when they commit
            to such platforms - essentially staking their livelihoods and
            reputations - the founders felt a compelling responsibility to
            create something different. They believed that any platform acting
            as a bridge between freelancers and clients should do so with
            integrity, transparency, and good faith. This belief laid the
            cornerstone for Tskr. Built on the principles of fairness and
            respect, Tskr is more than just a marketplace - it's a promise to
            freelancers and clients alike that they will be supported and
            treated justly in their professional endeavors.
